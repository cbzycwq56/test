1. We learned about Amazon AWS service today. When we are processing very large datasets or running very expensive algorithms. Using the hardwares from the server might give us more computational power and make our data processing easier. We learned about choosing the right instance for us because better performance instance might not be free and sometimes we don't need all the fancy feature.

2. We learned about linux and vim. We use linux because it is easy to use. We can run everything from the terminal. We use vim because it has a lot of useful commands. It also supports all the languages.

3. We learned about how to use github repository today. Github is important because it is used for version control. When a group of people works on a large project, if we do not use version control, everyone will be changing the code and it will be a mess. With version control, we can create new branches and we can always go back to a previous version.

4. We learned about linux shell command today. Shell allow us to write more efficient programs of linux commands. Such as for loops and pipes.

5. We learned about basic python language and the concept of class today. Python is a very easy language and it is also OOP, making it ideal for financial application.
